# Human-Activity-Recognition---Video
Project completed for my Computer Science final year. Extensively comparing through implementation: different types of video recognition algorithms including CNNs and a model developed using transfer learning.
1. Use IDE such as Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook
2. Download datasets wished to test:

KTH: https://www.csc.kth.se/cvap/actions/
hmdb51: https://serre-lab.clps.brown.edu/resource/hmdb-a-large-human-motion-database/
UCF50: https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF50.php

3. Choose classes from chosen dataset and enter in code for classes variables

4. unzip/unrar dataset -> unzip/unrar chosen classes

So directory should be dataset full of classes folders which in turn contain videos. No RAR/ZIP files

5. Change folder dataset directory in code

6. Run
